# Project Management Tool with Predictive Analytics Models for Forecasting Software Project Timelines

This is a full-stack, modular project management system developed as part of an academic research project. The system integrates predictive analytics, real-time delay forecasting, gamified task management, and a user-centered interface to enhance the planning, monitoring, and execution of software projects.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The platform aims to solve key challenges in modern software project management, including:

- Inaccurate forecasting of project timelines, defects, and effort.
- Lack of developer motivation and team engagement.
- Delayed detection of project risks and schedule overruns.
- Poor user experience and limited project visibility.

## üîç Core Features

### 1. Predictive Analytics (ML-Driven)
- **Timeline Prediction** ‚Äì Random Forest model forecasts project duration.
- **Defect Prediction** ‚Äì Predicts defect counts using project and code metrics.
- **Effort Estimation** ‚Äì Estimates total effort hours using the Desharnais dataset.
- **Task Allocation** ‚Äì Recommends best-fit teams using ensemble classification (XGBoost + Random Forest).
- **AI Assistant (Gemini API)** ‚Äì Offers LLM-powered estimations and explanations for duration, risk, and defect count.

### 2. Delay Prediction Component
- Binary classification model predicts task delay probability.
- Regression model estimates delay duration (in days).
- Integrated into CI/CD-like workflows with real-time supervisor alerts.

### 3. Gamification Engine
- Experience points (XP), skill tree unlocks, badges, and leaderboards.
- Motivation-driven design to increase productivity and accountability.
- React-based dynamic notifications and progression feedback.

### 4. UI/UX Dashboard
- Built using React.js + Tailwind CSS.
- Modular, responsive dashboards tailored for developers and project managers.
- Accessible and intuitive layout with progressive disclosure of predictive insights.
